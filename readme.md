# Node basic

- # Node module system

  - browser have a global window object, console.log and any function created with function keyword are in global but node use global object to store global property. By default function declared in node js file in included in global object

  - all js files are module and have module property which is used to export and import file
  - module have exports property, we can assign object or function in this module.exports property to export the functionality of that js file
  - to import js file we need to use require method with the file name with path. ie: require("./filename") or require("./filename.js")
  - the imported require method will return same data that was assigned in module.exports in that file
